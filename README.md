Note: This is still a work-in-progress

A rust driver for VS1003 audio codec focused on ensuring correctness and safety. Given that this will never be the most performant driver possible.

If you set out to create your own driver, hopefully at least the `vs1003-pac` (in pac directory) crate will be useful for you.
